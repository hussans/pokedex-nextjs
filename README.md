**Project Name**: Pokemon API Next Rebuild
<br/>
**Description**: This Next.js/TypeScript app uses the PokeAPI to let users search Gen 1-5 Pokémon by name or number, view details (image, shiny form, stats, abilities, moves, and evolution path), and save favorites. It includes a random Pokémon generator, displays a game location (or "N/A"), and is fully responsive with Tailwind CSS. A Figma prototype ensures a polished design for all screen sizes.
